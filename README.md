# mood_log

The streamlit app lets you select from 6 moods and then logs the timestamp of the submission, along with showing a bar graph for the day. It appends the info to a CSV. For future iterations, you can append to a Google sheet for scalability, but just to keep the spirit of doing the project quickly, I used a local CSV file.
